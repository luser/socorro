How to upload
-------------

To be able to upload you need to have an account with which you
have the ``Upload Symbols Files`` permission.

Once you have that, visit https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/symbols/
and there will be two links presented there.

One to do a regular web file upload in the browser.

And one that takes you to the documentation about how to do uploads
using the API. That link will have links to where you can set up
API tokens.
